JASON AJAX and JQUERY

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
Using AJAX you access documents on a server without having to reload the page. 
AJAX handles communication that happens between a server and a client or a browser. 
Any file using AJAX, has to run on an actual server, not on your local hard drive. 

In this project JSON file is imported into the JavaScript using AJAX. 
The file is being brought into the text editor through an FTP client that has access to that server.
Project consist of following 3 files:
1. data.json   : file having json object is placed on server.
2. myscript.js : ajax code that reads the file(on server), put it in output variable and send it to the element
3. index.html  : It contains the headline tag and list of links
