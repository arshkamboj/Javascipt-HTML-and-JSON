AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.Using AJAX you access documents 
on a server without having to reload the page.
AJAX has communication that happens between a server and a client or a browser.
Any file using AJAX, has to run on an actual server, not on your local hard drive. 

In this project JSON file is imported into the JavaScript using AJAX. The file is 
being brought into the text editor through an FTP client that has access to that server.

data.json file having json object is placed on server.
